# Data-Preparation-Machine-Learning-Comprehensive-Analysis-

This repository contains my work for the Continuous Assessments in the Data Preparation and Machine Learning modules of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics for Business at CCT College Dublin.

Project Overview

This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling using two datasets:
1️⃣ Spam Classification (CA1 – Data Preparation) 📨
2️⃣ Housing and Zoning Analysis (CA1 – Machine Learning) 🏡
3️⃣ Bike Rental Analysis (CA2 – Integrated Data Preparation & ML) 🚴‍♂️

Each assessment builds upon key data science and machine learning techniques, from cleaning and transforming data to training and evaluating predictive models.

📌 CA1 – Data Preparation (Spam Classification)

This section focuses on preparing a high-dimensional dataset for machine learning by:
✔️ Characterizing the dataset – Understanding size, missing values, and feature distributions.
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Using visualizations to analyze patterns.
✔️ Feature Engineering & Encoding – Transforming data for ML models.
✔️ Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) – Reducing features while maintaining 99.5% variance.
✔️ Curse of Dimensionality – Analyzing its impact on model performance.

🏡 CA1 – Machine Learning (Housing and Zoning Analysis)

This part applies machine learning techniques to predict housing-related variables:
✔️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
✔️ Feature Selection & Engineering – Identifying important attributes.
✔️ Model Training & Evaluation – Implementing Regression & Classification models.
✔️ Hyperparameter Tuning – Optimizing models with GridSearchCV.
✔️ Cross-Validation – Ensuring model reliability with k-fold validation.

🔹 Machine Learning Models:
🏠 Regression Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
📊 Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

🚴‍♂️ CA2 – Integrated Data Preparation & Machine Learning (Bike Rental Analysis)

This section combines Data Preparation and Machine Learning for a bike rental company:
✔️ EDA & Feature Engineering – Exploring customer behavior across cities, weather conditions, and age groups.
✔️ Dimensionality Reduction (PCA vs. LDA) – Comparing techniques to improve classification.
✔️ Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning – Justifying the chosen approach.
✔️ Hyperparameter Tuning & Feature Selection – Using Random Forest & GridSearchCV.
✔️ Cross-Validation & Model Comparison – Evaluating results using 10/20/30-fold cross-validation.
